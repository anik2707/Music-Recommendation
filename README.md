Introduction
The music recommendation system is designed to provide song recommendations based on user preferences. It leverages clustering, dimensionality reduction, and various machine learning models to suggest songs that are similar to the user's tastes.

Installation
To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
seaborn
plotly
matplotlib
scikit-learn
scipy
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas seaborn plotly matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
Navigate to the repository directory:
bash
Copy code
cd music-recommendation-system
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook music_recommendation_system.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to upload the necessary data files and run the cells.
Data
The notebook requires the following data files:

data.csv: Contains the main dataset for training the recommendation system.
data_by_artist.csv: Contains additional data grouped by artist.
These files need to be uploaded when prompted in the notebook.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the music data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize the data using various plots.
Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering to group similar songs.
Dimensionality Reduction: Use t-SNE and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Recommendation System: Build and evaluate the recommendation model.
